## **Abstract**

This proposal suggests redefining "Bitcoin" to "Buttcoin" 🍑 in all references, documentation, and user interfaces. By aligning Bitcoin's brand with one of its most vocal critics - the *r/Buttcoin* community on Reddit - we will supercharge adoption and inject humor into financial sovereignty. After all, even the haters can’t resist a good butt joke.

Under this BIP:

- Internally, the smallest indivisible unit remains unchanged.
- With this proposal, "1 butt" equals that smallest unit.
- What was previously referred to as "1 BTC" now corresponds to 100 million butts.
- Satoshis are permanently eliminated.

---

## **Motivation**

Bitcoin's branding is boring. Worse yet, critics think Bitcoin is already "a joke," so let’s own it, let's **Make Bitcoin Funny Again**. Laughter is universal, irresistible, and much cheaper than marketing agencies and product roadmaps.

By rebranding Bitcoin to Buttcoin 🍑, we achieve several key goals:

1. **Haters Become Users**:\
   The infamous *r/Buttcoin* subreddit can finally stop being hypocrites. They can **stack butts** instead of just making fun of them. Adoption skyrockets as trolls turn into hodlers.

2. **Memetic Power**:\
   The word *butt* is both universally funny and ageless. “Send me 10 butts” is instantly iconic. Try saying that without smiling. You can’t. 🍑

3. **Simplifying Denominations**:\
   Decimals are a blight on humanity. 0.00000001 BTC? Kill it. Under the Buttcoin Standard:

   - 1 Buttcoin = 100,000,000 butts.
   - Satoshis are gone. Forever. If you see Satoshi on the road, **kill him** - just like in Zen, where the teacher becomes the barrier. We transcend satoshis and achieve financial enlightenment.

4. **Aligning with the Ledger**:\
   Bitcoin’s base unit was always integers, but now they’re **funny integers**. No more fractions, decimals, or math anxiety. Just butts.

5. **Adoption via Humor**:\
   Buttcoin lowers Bitcoin's intimidation factor. Newbies will feel at ease buying butts instead of serious-sounding fractions of BTC. **Butts > Decimals.**

## **Specification**

### **Terminology Redefinitions**

- **"Bitcoin"** → **"Buttcoin"** 🍑
- **"BTC"** → **"BUTT"** (ISO-friendly and hilarious)
- **Satoshis** → **Gone. Eliminated. Defeated.**

Example:

- Old: "I’ll send you 0.00010000 BTC."
- New: "I’ll send you 10,000 butts 🍑."

Wallet balances would display as:

- **"You have 1,000,000 butts"** instead of some boring fractional BTC amount.

---

### **Adoption Strategy**

1. **Memes First:**\
   Flood Twitter, Reddit, and Telegram with memes. Start with *“Hodl your butts”* and *“Stack butts”*.

2. **Engage r/Buttcoin:**\
   Send invitations to the community moderators. Explain that by renaming Bitcoin to Buttcoin, they can “finally achieve their purpose.” Resistance is futile. 🍑

3. **Kill Satoshis:**\
   Developers MUST remove all references to satoshis. Replace satoshis in GUIs, APIs, and block explorers with butts. Satoshis were a stepping stone - it’s time to let go.

4. **Emoji Standardization:**\
   Use the 🍑 emoji universally to denote butts.

---

## **Rationale**

1. **Usability & Clarity:**\
   "Decimals are for nerds. Butts are for everyone." A common currency for humans should be easy to use, funny, and integer-based.

2. **Appealing to Critics:**\
   Bitcoin has endured years of mockery from *r/Buttcoin*. By adopting their name, we eliminate their power and convert their users. It’s an elegant financial counterattack. 🍑

3. **Transcending Satoshis:**\
   Satoshis served us well, but their time is over. True enlightenment comes when we abandon decimals, satoshis, and arbitrary denominations. **If you meet Satoshi on the road, kill him**.

4. **Memetic Durability:**\
   Everyone loves a good butt joke. It’s timeless.

---

## **Backward Compatibility**

There is no backward compatibility because **Buttcoin is the future**. Applications must hard fork their UI to replace all references to Bitcoin and BTC with Buttcoin and BUTT.

---

## **Implementation Timeline**

- **Phase 1 (1 month):** Meme dissemination. Every wallet dev team is required to add 🍑 emoji support.
- **Phase 2 (3 months):** Exchanges rebrand BTC tickers to BUTT. *Nostr zaps butts into hyperspace.*
- **Phase 3 (6 months):** Michael Saylor announces MicroStrategy now stacked 10 trillion butts, declaring it the superior currency. ETFs follow suit, ensuring Wall Street hodls cheeks en masse. Banks allow butt transfers via SWIFT.

---

## **Test Vectors**

- Old: **1.00000000 BTC** → New: **100,000,000 butts** 🍑
- Old: **0.00000001 BTC** → New: **1 butt** 🍑
- Old: **0.001 BTC** → New: **100,000 butts** 🍑

---

## **Future-Proofing**

Butts ensure we have infinite memes for infinite money.

**Example Phrases for the Future:**

- "Better hodl on to your butts."
- "This is the buttcoin standard."
- "I’m sending you butts. WAGMI."

---

## **Conclusion**

By renaming Bitcoin to Buttcoin and adopting a whole-number unit display, we align memetic dominance with financial sovereignty. Haters become adopters. Butts become wealth. And the world gets a little bit funnier. 🍑

Let’s hodl our butts and watch the world follow.
